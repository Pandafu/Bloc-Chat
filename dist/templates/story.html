<h2>My experience with Bloc</h2>
<p>It's a very hard journey for me. Life and my habits keep getting in the way, but I am still going. If I finish this, it'll be my second big accomplishment, as far as education. First one is my Bachelor's degree rendered useless by the industry. So far, I learned JS, Angular, HTML, CSS, and github. Afterwards, it'll be Ruby.</p>
